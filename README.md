# Power-Bi-Dashboard-on-ESG-Performance
Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing ESG disclosure consistency and performance across US industrial companies (2012–2021).

Project Overview
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) disclosures vary significantly across companies and time.
This project analyzes how consistently companies disclose ESG data and how disclosure depth relates to ESG performance and firm size.

Dataset Source:
72 US industrial companies
Time period: 2012–2021
Metrics:
ESG Score - Environmental, Social, Governance pillars

Tools & Skills:
Power BI Desktop:
DAX (CALCULATE, FILTER, DISTINCTCOUNT)
Interactive dashboards (slicers, bookmarks, tooltips)
Excel for data cleaning

Key Analytical Questions:
Are companies becoming more transparent over time?
Does higher ESG disclosure correlate with better ESG scores?
How does firm size influence disclosure completeness?
Which companies are consistent ESG performers across years?

Key Insights:
Disclosure rates improved over time, but environmental data remains the least consistently reported.
Larger firms disclose more ESG data on average, but higher disclosure does not always imply higher ESG scores.
Companies with consistent multi-year disclosure tend to rank higher in average ESG performance.
